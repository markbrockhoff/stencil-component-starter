# Stencil JS Vue Output Target Vue Issue

This is a small demo Project to reproduce the issue submitted [here](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil-ds-output-targets/issues/233).

To run it, just make the script "demo.sh" in the root of this project executable and run it:

```bash
chmod +x demo.sh
bash ./demo.sh
```

This will install all dependencies and build everything.
At the end you will see the error Property 'modelValue' is missing in type..." as described in the [issue](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil-ds-output-targets/issues/233).
